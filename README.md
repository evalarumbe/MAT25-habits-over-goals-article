# Static website: article example

[See this site deployed on Netlify](https://habits-over-goals.netlify.app/)

This article was created in support of a 2-week course on web development for beginners. By the end of the two weeks, students can expect to come away with the skills to build something similar.

The article by James Clear was selected for its subject matter, because after teaching a number of diverse adult classes, this advice is what I feel is most important to the success of people who are new to coding.

The content of the website is not my work, and references have been provided to the original author and photographers.
